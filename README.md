# Newp

My personal and hacky Go script for setting up project skeletons. This is
how I save a few minutes and avoid repeating myself everytime I wish to
sprint some hacky code.

# Usage

    newp -l [language] -n [name]

ie.

    newp -l go -n my_project

creates a new directory in the current directory named `my_project`. In
this directory there will be some basic files and code for kick starting
a project in the specified language.
